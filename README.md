# OS-Simulation-project
A scheduling program of processes in c language  

The program is a scheduler which schedules the program using a round-robin preemptive method.
=> The time quantum concept is implemented
=> The priority is also given to processes and the program also checks for priority
=> The aging concept is also implemented which prevents the starvation of low priority process.

#please let me know if any test cases not working properly.
Also if u found any other efficient method to implement any block of program do let me know.
